Demonstrates some of the new features and library changes in Java 11 in a test-driven approach with JUnit 5. All test cases live in `src/test/java`. The main source code under `src/main/java` contains examples that demonstrate the use of open source libraries as a replacement for the removed Java EE modules.

The repository contains build scripts for Maven and Gradle. For building the project the checked-in Wrappers should be used.

=== Maven

./mvnw test
```

=== Gradle
